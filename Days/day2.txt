python version : 2 and 3
currently in my journey i am learning python3 

Installed python 3.13.7 from python.org
Add path.exe checkbox while doing setup of installation of python

In cmd run >>python3
this will start python in terminal itself

Now you can run commands such as
2+2
>4
2>1
>True
2>
Syntax Error:invalid syntax(It is an kind of error which is due to bad syntax or bad grammar in the code)

This all are expression(An expression is a piece of code that produces a value)

Tools ------- IDE(Integrated Development Environment)

Editors
e.g. Sublime,vscode,atom

An IDE is basically a code editor with some
fancy features like:
1 Autocompletion
2 Debugging
3 Testing

# first-program:
In our first program, we have use python built-in
function called print().
So ,in python we have various function for performing
various kinds of tasks.

print() syntax:;
print(*objects,sep='',end='\n',file=sys.stdout(),flush=False)

*objects → One or more things you want to print.
e.g. print("Hello", "World")   # Hello World

sep → Separator between objects (default is space ' ').
print("A", "B", "C", sep="-")   # A-B-C

end → What to print at the end (default is newline '\n')
print("Hello", end=" ")  
print("World")            # Output: Hello World

file → Where to print (default is sys.stdout → console).
with open("output.txt", "w") as f:
    print("Hello File", file=f)

flush → Whether to force flushing the output buffer (default False).
print("Hello", flush=True)

🐍 Python 2 (old, now outdated)

In Python 2, print was a statement, not a function.
So you could write:

print "Hello, World!"
print "A", "B", "C"

Default separator = space ( )

Default end = newline (\n)

You could also redirect with >>:
print >> sys.stderr, "Error message"

#IDE Features
1 Linting: Analyzing our code for potential errors
2 Debugging: Finding and fixing bugs
3 Autocompletion: Helps us write our code faster by autocompletion
4 code formatting: Making our code look clean and readable
5 unit testing: writing bunch of tests for our code
6 code snippets: reusable code block that we can quickly generate

# Extensions to install in vscode to convert into a powerful IDE:
- python
- pylance
- autopep8

# Formatting python code:

PEPs(Python Enhaancement Proposals)
 python peps:
    - pep8 is the most famous and widely used pep for formatting python code

# shortcut:
ctrl+` for opening terminal
ctrl+shift+p for opening command palette

type format document and then install autopep8 extension and also enable format on save in command palette
