Installed python 3.13.7 from python.org
Add path.exe checkbox while doing setup of installation of python

# first-program:
In our first program, we have use python built-in
function called print().
So ,in python we have various function for performing
various kinds of tasks.

print() syntax:;
print(*objects,sep='',end='\n',file=sys.stdout(),flush=False)

*objects → One or more things you want to print.
e.g. print("Hello", "World")   # Hello World

sep → Separator between objects (default is space ' ').
print("A", "B", "C", sep="-")   # A-B-C

end → What to print at the end (default is newline '\n')
print("Hello", end=" ")  
print("World")            # Output: Hello World

file → Where to print (default is sys.stdout → console).
with open("output.txt", "w") as f:
    print("Hello File", file=f)

flush → Whether to force flushing the output buffer (default False).
print("Hello", flush=True)

🐍 Python 2 (old, now outdated)

In Python 2, print was a statement, not a function.
So you could write:

print "Hello, World!"
print "A", "B", "C"

Default separator = space ( )

Default end = newline (\n)

You could also redirect with >>:
print >> sys.stderr, "Error message"
