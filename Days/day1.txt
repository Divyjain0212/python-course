Python is one of the fastest-growing programming languages, widely used by software engineers, data analysts, accountants, scientists, network engineers, and even beginners, including kids.

Key features of Python:

General-purpose: Can be used to build a wide range of applications, from web development to AI.
High-level: Easy to read and write, close to human language.
Dynamically typed: No need to explicitly declare data types.
Interpreted: Code is executed line by line, making debugging easier.

but what makes python so special?

1 solves complex problems in lesser or fewer lines of code
e.g. str[0:3],to returns first 3 characters of a string

2 python is a multipurpose programming language
It is used for:

- Data Analysis , AI/ML ,Automation ,Web Apps ,Desktop Apps ,Mobile Apps ,testing ,hacking

3 Python is a high level language(No need to do memory management (Automatically done by python))

4 Python has huge community ,so if you ever feeling stuck in your code there is someone out there to help you

5 Python is a cross-platform programming language, which means Python code can run on multiple operating 
systems such as Windows, Linux, and macOS without requiring major changes.

6 Python has a large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, which makes it suitable for diverse domains 
such as web development, data science, machine learning, automation, and more.
